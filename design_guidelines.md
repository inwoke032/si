# Design Guidelines: Plan de Pasant√≠a Interactivo PWA

## Design Approach

**Selected Approach:** Hybrid - Design System Foundation + Custom Interactive Elements

**Rationale:** This is a productivity/planning tool requiring efficiency and learnability, but with a warm, motivational character. We'll use Material Design 3 principles for component behavior and interactions, while maintaining the existing "Tierra Suave" color palette for brand consistency and emotional connection.

**Key Design Principles:**
1. **Motivational Warmth:** Celebrate progress with subtle animations and positive feedback
2. **Effortless Navigation:** Clear information hierarchy with instant access to all views
3. **Touch-First Interactions:** Optimized for mobile with intuitive gestures
4. **Offline Resilience:** Visual indicators of sync status and offline capability

### E. Animations

**Use Sparingly, Purposefully:**

- **Task completion:** Checkbox scale + confetti particles (celebrate wins!)
- **Progress updates:** Smooth counter animations (animate from previous to new value)
- **Calendar navigation:** Slide left/right for month changes (200ms)

## Images

**No hero image required** - This is a utility app where functionality takes precedence over marketing imagery.

**Icon Usage:**
- Lucide icons or Heroicons for UI elements (24px standard size)
- Larger icons (48px) for empty states and celebration screens
- Category icons for different task types (book for study, code bracket for programming, etc.)

## Quality Standards

**Performance:**
- Lazy load Chart.js only when needed
- Optimize service worker caching strategy
- Minimize CSS animations (use transform and opacity only)

**Accessibility:**
- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation for all features
- Focus indicators with primary color ring
- Minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1 for text

**Touch Targets:**
- Minimum 44x44px for all interactive elements
- Adequate spacing between tap targets (8px minimum)
- Visual feedback on touch (slight opacity change)

This design creates a warm, motivational productivity app that feels native on any device while maintaining easy deployment to GitHub Pages.
